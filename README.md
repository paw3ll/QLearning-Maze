# QLearning-Maze
A small example of Q learning given a set reward matrix and graph with corresponding weighted edges.

Q-Learning is a reinforcement learning technique used in machine learning. The goal of Q-Learning is to learn a policy, which
tells an agent what action to take under what circumstance. It does not require a model of the environment and can handle
problems with stochastic transitions and rewards, without requiring adaptations.(1)
